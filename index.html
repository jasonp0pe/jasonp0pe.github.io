                <p>To create the "Brat - Charli XCX" page, I used basic HTML elements like `h1`, `p`, `ul`, and `img` to structure the content, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and images. 
                    These elements allowed me to organize the album's information effectively while maintaining a clean and visually appealing layout..</p>

                <p>For my second assignment, "Basic CSS," I created a dolphin-themed webpage using HTML and CSS. 
                    I implemented a navigation bar with `nav` and `ul` tags, organized content about dolphins using `section`, `h1`, `p`, and `figure` tags, and added images with descriptions.</p>

                <p>For the "Layout with Flex" assignment, I used HTML and CSS Flexbox to create a responsive webpage layout with a navigation bar, titles, and content sections.</p>

                <p>For my Assignment 4, I recreated the USC Graduate School Admissions webpage. I implemented the same layout, while utilizing Flexbox for a responsive design.
                    I used placeholder images from "place-hold.it", ensuring all links were disabled by setting their href to "#".</p>

                <p>For Assignment 7, I created an interactive webpage using JavaScript. The page features a click counter, a random image refresher, and a slider that moves a square based on the slider's position. 
                JavaScript was used to handle the interactions and dynamically update the content of the page.</p>

                <p>The "Chess Pieces Unveiled" project is a website focused on exploring the movements, strengths, and strategic roles of each chess piece, such as the King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn. It will provide information about special chess moves like castling and pawn promotion. 
                It will feature an interactive database of strategies and a submission system where users can see how the chess moves work in real time.</p>
