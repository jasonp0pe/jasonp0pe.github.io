                <p>To create the "Brat - Charli XCX" page, I used basic HTML elements like `h1`, `p`, `ul`, and `img` to structure the content, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and images. These elements allowed me to organize the album's information effectively while maintaining a clean and visually appealing layout..</p>

                <p>For my second assignment, "Basic CSS," I created a dolphin-themed webpage using HTML and CSS. I implemented a navigation bar with `nav` and `ul` tags, organized content about dolphins using `section`, `h1`, `p`, and `figure` tags, and added images with descriptions. Additionally, I designed a CSS-styled table with `table`,and `td` tags, demonstrating my ability to structure and style web content effectively.</p>

                <p>For the "Layout with Flex" assignment, I used HTML and CSS Flexbox to create a responsive webpage layout with a navigation bar, titles, and content sections. By applying Flexbox commands like `display: flex;`, I ensured that elements are evenly spaced and adapt well to different screen sizes..</p>
